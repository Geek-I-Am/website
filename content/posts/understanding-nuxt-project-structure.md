In our previous tutorial, 
[getting started with nuxt](https://geekiam.io/getting-started-with-nuxt "Getting started with nuxt | Geek.I.Am") 
we explored the basics of getting started with Nuxt the intuitive Vue Framework.  We started the development of a
Server Rendered Page application. The Nuxt team have focused on making this a stream lined purpose. 

After you have generated your nuxt application you will see the nuxt project folder structure below.
```shell
└──  <project directory >
    ├── assets
    ├── components
    ├── content
    ├── jest.config.js
    ├── layouts
    ├── middleware
    ├── node_modules
    ├── nuxt.config.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── pages
    ├── plugins
    ├── README.md
    ├── static
    ├── store
    └── test

```
If you open your project in an IDE, in my case I prefer to use [Webstorm - The smartest JavaScript IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "Webstorm - The smartest JavaScript IDE | Jetbrains"),
your project directory will appear as follows:
