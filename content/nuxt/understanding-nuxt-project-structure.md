In our previous tutorial, 
[getting started with nuxt](https://geekiam.io/getting-started-with-nuxt "Getting started with nuxt | Geek.I.Am") 
we explored the basics of getting started with Nuxt the intuitive Vue Framework.  We started the development of a
Server Rendered Page application. The Nuxt team have focused on making this a stream lined purpose. 

After you have generated your nuxt application you will see the nuxt project folder structure below.
```shell
└──  <project directory >
    ├── assets
    ├── components
    ├── content
    ├── jest.config.js
    ├── layouts
    ├── middleware
    ├── node_modules
    ├── nuxt.config.js
    ├── package.json
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── pages
    ├── plugins
    ├── README.md
    ├── static
    ├── store
    └── test

```
If you open your project in an IDE, in my case I prefer to use [Webstorm - The smartest JavaScript IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "Webstorm - The smartest JavaScript IDE | Jetbrains"),
your project directory will appear as follows:

Let's go through each of them in order to understand there intended purpose and gain an overview of the framework 
generated by nuxt for us.

### The assets directory

The `assets` directory is primarily used to store assets such images, fonts, Less, Sass, Stylus file etc. Any files 
placed in this directory will be compiled by [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/ "Webpack") and made available for use 
in your application.

### The static directory

The `static` directory is used to store files that you don't require or cannot be compiled by webpack.  If you don't 
want to serve your assets such as images, fonts, styles.  All files in this directory are mapped to the server root 
directly, therefore they accessible under the root URL directly.

### The pages directory

The `pages` directory is used to contain the views and the routes of the application.  Nuxt will read and convert and
convert all the `.vue` files inside this directory and generate the application router automatically.

### The layouts directory

The `layouts` directory is used to store the layout files for your application. Nuxt generates a `default.vue` by default,
you can modify this default layout or add new files to the directory.

### The components directory

The `components` directory is used to store Vue components.  You should keep small and reusable components in this 
directory.

### The plugins directory

The `plugins` directory is used to store your global Javascript functions that you want to run before the root Vue 
instance is instantiated . 

### The store directory

The `store` directory is used to contain the Vuex store. There is no need to install Vuex in Nuxt because it is already
installed. It is disabled by default and all you need to do enable it is add an `index.js` file to this directory.

### The middleware directory

The `middleware` directory is used to store middleware files that are Javascript functions that run before rendering a
page or group of pages.

### The package.json

The `package.json` file is used to contain the dependencies and scripts of the Nuxt application. 

### The nuxt.config.js 

The `nuxt.config.js` file is used to carry out any custom configuration you would like applied to your application.

### Conclusion

We have discussed and provided a basic overview of the typical directory structure that Nuxt provides out the box. In 
further tutorial series on [using nuxt for web development](https://geekiam.io "Using Nuxt for web development | Geek.I.Am") 
we will further explore and provide detailed information on how to make use of the Nuxt Directory structure.
