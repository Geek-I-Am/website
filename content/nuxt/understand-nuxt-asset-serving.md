The `assets` directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus, Sass files, images, or fonts. Nuxt makes use of:
* `vue-loader` - A webpack loader to enable you to author Vue components as `Single-File Components`
* `file-loader` - A webpack loader to resolve `import`/`require()` on a file into a url and emits the file into 
  the output directory.
* `url-loader` - A webpack loader to transform files into base64 URIs.

Nuxt will use `vue-loader` to process the `<template>` and `<style>` blocks with `css-loader` and `vue-template-compiler`
to compile elements such as `<img src="...">`, `background-image: URL(...)`, and CSS `@import` in these blocks into 
module dependencies. 

```html
// pages/index.vue
<template>
  <img src="~/assets/sample-1.jpg">
</template>

<style>
.container {
  background-image: url("~assets/sample-2.jpg");
}
</style>
```
The image element and the assets in the preceding `<template>` and `<style>` blocks will be compiled and translated 
into the following code and module dependencies.

```javascript
createElement('img', { attrs: { src: require('~/assets/sample-1.jpg') }})
require('~/assets/sample-2.jpg')
```

After the preceding compilation and translation, Nuxt then will use `file-loader` to resolve the `import`/`require`
module dependencies into a URL and emit the assets into the output directory â€“ or, use `url-loader` to transform the 
assets into Base64 URIs if the asset is under 1 KB. 

if asset are larger than the 1 KB threshold, it will fall back to `file-loader`. That means any files below 1 KB will 
be inlined as a Base64 data URL by `url-loader`

This provides more control over the number of HTTP requests from your app server, because inlined assets reduce the 
HTTP requests, while larger files are copied to a folder with version hash for improved caching.
