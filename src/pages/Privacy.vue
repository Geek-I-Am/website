            YOUR RIGHTS

            9.1

            In this Section 9, we have summarised the rights that you have under data protection law. Some of the rights
            are complex, and not all of the details have been included in our summaries. Accordingly, you should read
            the relevant laws and guidance from the regulatory authorities for a full explanation of these rights.

            9.2

            Your principal rights under data protection law are:

            (a)

            the right to access;

            (b)

            the right to rectification;

            (c)

            the right to erasure;

            (d)

            the right to restrict processing;

            (e)

            the right to object to processing;

            (f)

            the right to data portability;

            (g)

            the right to complain to a supervisory authority; and

            (h)

            the right to withdraw consent.

            9.3

            You have the right to confirmation as to whether or not we process your personal data and, where we do,
            access to the personal data, together with certain additional information. That additional information
            includes details of the purposes of the processing, the categories of personal data concerned and the
            recipients of the personal data. Providing the rights and freedoms of others are not affected, we will
            supply to you a copy of your personal data. The first copy will be provided free of charge, but additional
            copies may be subject to a reasonable fee.

            9.4

            You have the right to have any inaccurate personal data about you rectified and, taking into account the
            purposes of the processing, to have any incomplete personal data about you completed.

            9.5

            In some circumstances you have the right to the erasure of your personal data without undue delay. Those
            circumstances include: the personal data are no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which they
            were collected or otherwise processed; you withdraw consent to consent-based processing; you object to the
            processing under certain rules of applicable data protection law; the processing is for direct marketing
            purposes; and the personal data have been unlawfully processed. However, there are exclusions of the right
            to erasure. The general exclusions include where processing is necessary: for exercising the right of
            freedom of expression and information; for compliance with a legal obligation; or for the establishment,
            exercise or defence of legal claims.

            9.6

            In some circumstances you have the right to restrict the processing of your personal data. Those
            circumstances are: you contest the accuracy of the personal data; processing is unlawful but you oppose
            erasure; we no longer need the personal data for the purposes of our processing, but you require personal
            data for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; and you have objected to processing,
            pending the verification of that objection. Where processing has been restricted on this basis, we may
            continue to store your personal data. However, we will only otherwise process it: with your consent; for the
            establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims; for the protection of the rights of another natural or
            legal person; or for reasons of important public interest.

            9.7

            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data on grounds relating to your particular
            situation, but only to the extent that the legal basis for the processing is that the processing is
            necessary for: the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of any
            official authority vested in us; or the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third
            party. If you make such an objection, we will cease to process the personal information unless we can
            demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and
            freedoms, or the processing is for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.

            9.8

            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for direct marketing purposes
            (including profiling for direct marketing purposes). If you make such an objection, we will cease to process
            your personal data for this purpose.

            9.9

            You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data for scientific or historical research
            purposes or statistical purposes on grounds relating to your particular situation, unless the processing is
            necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.

            9.10

            To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal data is:

            (a)

            consent; or

            (b)

            that the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to
            take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract,

            and such processing is carried out by automated means, you have the right to receive your personal data from
            us in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. However, this right does not apply where it
            would adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.

            9.11

            If you consider that our processing of your personal information infringes data protection laws, you have a
            legal right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority responsible for data protection. You may do so
            in the EU member state of your habitual residence, your place of work or the place of the alleged
            infringement.

            9.12

            To the extent that the legal basis for our processing of your personal information is consent, you have the
            right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of processing before
            the withdrawal.

            9.13

            You may exercise any of your rights in relation to your personal data by written notice to us, in addition
            to the other methods specified in this Section 9.

            9.14

            Where you request access to personal information, we are required by law to use reasonable means to verify
            your identity before doing so. The first copy will be provided free of charge. If your requests for copies
            are excessive or manifestly unfounded, and in particular if they are of a repetitive nature, we may charge a
            reasonable fee to cover administrative costs of providing you with such information or communicating with
            you in regard to that information or taking the action requested by you or refusing to act on your request.
            This is set out in Article 12 of the GDPR.

            Our website and services are targeted at persons over the age of 18.

            11.2

            UPDATING INFORMATION

            ACTING AS A DATA PROCESSOR

            13.1

            In respect of hosted services we do not act as a data controller; instead, we act as a data processor.

            13.2

            Insofar as we act as a data processor rather than a data controller, this policy shall not apply. Our legal
            obligations as a data processor are instead set out in the contract between us and the relevant data
            controller.

            ABOUT COOKIES

            14.1

            A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server
            to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the
            browser requests a page from the server.

            14.2

            Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web
            browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date;
            a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is
            closed.

            14.3

            Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal information
            that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies.

            15.
