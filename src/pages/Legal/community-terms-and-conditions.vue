                    the Communities are those of the author of the user content,
                    but these do not necessarily represent the opinions, views
                    and values of Geek.I.Am. Accordingly, Geek.I.Am is not
                    responsible for the content or the accuracy, or for any

                    believes it is otherwise objectionable and will make every
                    effort to do so within a reasonable time frame, if removal
                    is determined necessary. However, you need to be aware that
                    this is a manual process, so it may not be possible to
                    remove or edit particular user content immediately.

                <p>

                    Geek.I.Am hereby excludes any and all liability arising out
                    of any actions (including, but not limited to those set out
                    above) that Geek.I.Am may take in response to breaches of
                    these Terms.

                <h3>LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
                <p>
                    To the fullest extent permissible by law, Geek.I.Am accepts
                    no liability to any user for any loss or damage, whether
                    foreseeable or otherwise, in contract, tort (including
                    negligence), for breach of statutory duty or otherwise,
                    arising out of or in connection with the use of (or
                    inability to use) the Communities or the use of or reliance
                    upon any user content or other content included in the
                    Communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In no event will Geek.I.Am be liability for any damages
                    whatsoever or howsoever (including, without limitation,
                    damages for loss of revenue, loss of profits, loss of
                    goodwill or reputation, business opportunity, loss of data,
                    business interruption or any indirect of consequential
                    damage) arising from the use of the Communities and / or any
                    content (included user content) posted in the Communities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geek.I.Am accepts no responsibility for any links to other
                    sites that may be included in the Communities. Unless
                    expressly stated, these sites are not under Geek.I.Amâ€™s
                    control so Geek.I.Am cannot accept responsibility or
                    liability for the content of any such third-party sites. The
                    inclusion of a link to another site in any user content in
                    the Communities is for information only and does not imply
                    any endorsement of the sites themselves or of those in
                    control of them by Geek.I.Am.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While Geek.I.Am takes all reasonable steps to ensure that
                    the Communities are free from viruses and other malware,
                    Geek.I.Am accepts no liability for any loss or damage
                    resulting from a virus or other malware, a distributed
                    denial of service attack, or other harmful material or event
                    that may adversely affect your hardware, software, data or
                    other material that occurs as a result of your use of the
                    Communities (including the downloading of any content from
                    it).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Geek.I.Am neither assumes nor accepts responsibility or
                    liability arising out of any disruption or non-availability
                    of the Communities resulting from external causes including,
                    but not limited to, ISP equipment failure, host equipment
                    failure, communications network failure, natural events,
                    acts of war, or legal restrictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nothing in these Terms excludes or restricts Geek.I.Amâ€™s
                    liability for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation, for
                    death or personal injury resulting from negligence, or for
                    any other forms of liability which cannot be excluded or
                    restricted by law.
