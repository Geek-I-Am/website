Often when creating Git based version control repositories, there will be certain types of files or even folders that you will want to exclude from being controlled and managed within your respository.  These could be files that could be generated by your project at run time or output from various processes .  Integrated Development Environments (IDE) and Operating Systems (OS)  also generate hidden files and system generated file which should also be exluded from respositories. 

Git makes this job really easy for you by enabling you to create a `.gitignore` file.

### What is the .gitignore file

A `.gitignore` file is essentially a text-based file that  developers can use to list specific files, file types and folders to be excluded from being added or managed by a git repository.   

[Git is a popular version control system](https://geekiam.io/what-is-git/ "What is git")provides the ability to create a Global and Local and these have very specific purposes and developers should definitely making use of both these ignore file options on their development workstations.

#### What is a Global .gitignore file

All the popular OS (Linux, Mac OS and Windows) often create hidden files in directories that will often contain metadata and other information which you typically don't want to include in a git repository.  These not only add clutter to your git repository but they could potentially leak sensitive information.   Developers should also exclude files and directories created by their favourite tools and frameworks that are not necessary to be included.

All these files and directories could be added to a local .gitignore file to be excluded, but this is not regarded as best practice. Due in part, that it becomes complicated and does clutter your project specific gitignore file with all the various OS specific and Tool specific file types.

Most developers will be creating and sharing hundreds of git repositories and having to remember copying these settings over project to project is less than ideal. Fortunately,  git enables you to create a Global .gitignore file which is respected by git throughout your User Directory with rules that should be applied to every git repository.  

This is usually achieved by creating a hidden file in your Home directory with rules that are specific to your system. A global .gitignore file is best used for common files like `.env` , `.DS_Store` , `node_modules` etc  which you will almost never want to commit to a git repository.

#### How to create a Global .gitignore File

We mentioned earlier that a `.gitignore` is just really a simple text-based file and they are really simple to create.  In this example we'll create a Global `.gitignore` using the terminal window , in our home directory

```sh
touch $HOME/.gitignore
```

This will have created a blank hidden `.gitignore` in our Home direcory.  We verify that it exists by :

```sh
ls - a $HOME
```

![.gitignore file in directory](/uploads/global-gitignore.png ".gitignore file in directory")

We can now populate this file with our environment specific data that we would like to exclude from any new or existing repositories we create and use on our machine.  Github provide a very useful [ collection of useful Global .gitignore templates ](https://github.com/github/gitignore/tree/master/Global) you can use to tailor your global file.

In my particular case, I predominantly use [Jetbrains Based IDE's and Tools](https://www.jetbrains.com/) such as [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/ "Webstorm - The smartest JavaScript IDE"), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/ "Rider Fast & powerful, cross-platform .NET IDE"), [PHPStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/ "PhpStorm The Lightning-Smart PHP IDE"), [GoLand](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/ "Goland cross-platform IDE built specially for Go developers")  etc  on Linux based computers.  So typically use the defaults that are provided in [Jetbrains Ignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/JetBrains.gitignore) and the [Linux Ignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Global/Linux.gitignore) file settings.    I do this by opening the new created `.gitinore` in my prefered text editor and pasting these values in.

```shell script
nano $HOME/.gitignore
```

The values I typically include are:

Once we have finished creating our file, we now need to configure Git to make use of it.  We do so by using the following command

```sh
git config ---global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore
```

These settings are now recognised and respected throughout all git repositories on your machine.  However,  the global gitignore file shouldn't be considered a great solution for all your collaborative repositories, because undoubtedly other developers on your team etc may not actually set this up or they may have a completely different settings as you.  

### What is a local .gitignore file

A local `.gitignore` file is usually placed in the root directory of a project and will contain project specific settings pertaining to the files and directories you wish to exclude from your project. 

Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns from multiple sources, with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest.

Patterns read from a .gitignore file in the same directory as the path, or in any parent directory, with patterns in the higher level files (up to the toplevel of the work tree) being overridden by those in lower level files down to the directory containing the file. These patterns match relative to the location of the .gitignore file. A project normally includes such .gitignore files in its repository, containing patterns for files generated as part of the project build.

### How to create a local .gitignore file

The process of creating a local gitignore file is the same as creating is similar to the global gitignore, in that you just create a text based file named .gitignore file in your project directory. Then include the settings you wish. However, personally I find the process of creating gitignore files tedious and boring and like all programmers should I have created an automated process to accomplish this task. 

As we mentioned earlier [Githib provides a collection of useful .gitignore templates](https://github.com/github/gitignore) to use for creating your gitignore file. By making use of a simple Curl command to download the version of gitignore file we want from the repository.  For instance if want to create a typical .gitignore for a NodeJS project we simply execute the following command in our terminal window

```sh
curl -o .gitignore  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/Node.gitignore
```

This will download the Node.gitIgnore file to our directory and save it as `.gitignore`.    If we insepct the content of this file it contains the all the typical gitignore rules for NodeJS basedf projects..

```sh

Using this command with the name of your preferred programming language can download typical settings required for that language.

```sh
## The language name passed in should follow the naming convention listed in the file name available 
## https://github.com/github/gitignore
curl -o .gitignore  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/github/gitignore/master/<Programming Language here>.gitignore
```

### How to add your own entries to gitignore

On occassion you may want to add additional rules to your gitignore file and this is very easy to do so and there are just a few things you need to know regarding the syntax used in gitignore files

The entries in this file can also follow a matching pattern.

* `*` is used as a wildcard match
* `/` is used to ignore path names relative to the .gitignore file
* `#` is used to add comments to a .gitignore file

Some typical examples of implementing rules may be:

```sh
# Ignore the node_modules folder in the project directory
node_modules

## Ignore all named local environment variable files   i.e.  .env.development.local etc
.env.**.local

## Ignore all files in the .cache folder

.cache/

## ignore all files in the temp folder in src folder with a .tmp extension but include others

src/temp/**.tmp
```
