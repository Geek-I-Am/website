Probably the most popular and common tool amongst software developers, regardless of programming language or specialism is the terminal window.  For the most developers it will be the one tool, they are more than likely going to use everyday. In fact, the whole reason why I am writing this post, is because I know and have kept track of all the tools I touch and use on a daily basis, and by far it is the terminal window, is where I spend a lot of my time on a daily basis.
