Probably the most popular and common tool amongst software developers, regardless of programming language or specialism is the terminal window.  For the most developers it will be the one tool, they are more than likely going to use everyday. In fact, the whole reason why I am writing this post, is because I know and have kept track of all the tools I touch and use on a daily basis, and by far it is the terminal window, is where I spend a lot of my time on a daily basis.

In order to become a successful software developer, it is essential to gain an understanding and become familiar with using the terminal window, you'll soon discover that there is a whole different computing world that suddenly opens up for you.  However, it may seem incredibly daunting when you start taking your first steps.

This post, is not meant to be an all encompassing guide on how to use the terminal window,  it's aim is just to be a gentle introductory guide for developers who are not yet familiar with the terminal window.

### What is a terminal window

A terminal window, also referred to as a terminal emulator, is a text-only window in a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that emulates a console.

In computing a window is typically a rectangular area in a GUI that that presents its contents, i.e an image, the contents of a text file, or a listing of the contents of a directory, seemingly independently of the rest of the screen and that can be moved, resized or otherwise manipulated independently of other objects on the screen.

The terminal window derives its name, from the fact that it emulates the text-only monitor and keyboard combinations that were commonly used for earlier generations of multi-user computers and which were referred to as *terminals* or *consoles*.

The term console, is often used in regards to Linux and other Unix-like (*nix) operating systems, is an all-text mode user interface that occupies the entire screen of the display device and which does not sit on top of a GUI. Prior to the launching of the Apple Macintosh in 1984, virtually all computer displays were console.
 
When accessing a *nix based servers, there is typically no GUI other than console command access, administrators will usually only manage the server only using terminal window.

The [Linux Information Project](http://www.linfo.org/index.html) has a comprehensive discussion regarding the [Terminal Window](http://www.linfo.org/terminal_window.html)
 which will provide additional useful background information.

All leading Operating Systems provide a Terminal or Console Application equivalent,  although functionality, implementation language and access my vary the underlying concepts will apply.

### Linux
All Linux distributions (distros) provide a Terminal Window on their Desktop Software editions and for Linux server editions the only way to manage and administer the server is by making use of the Terminal.

### Mac OS
Apple Mac OS provides a Terminal Application, which
