Many people believe that in order to become a good software developer, engineer or coder that you will need to be able 
to write good code fast.  The truth is, that in order to write good code, you first need to be able read, comprehend
and understand code written by others. 

It's also a common misconception that software developers are geeks or hackers working in isolation on their own
tapping furiously on their keyboards whilst solving deep and complex problems.  

The reality is, developers probably only 10% of their time actually writing code.   This fact is also discussed 
[The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering](https://threenine.co.uk) 

The other 90% of their time, is spent:
 * Reading
 * Interacting
 * Engaging
 * Collaborating
 * Integrating
 * Re-purposing
 * Re-engineering
 * Rewriting 
 
code developed by other software developers from all over the world.

In all likelihood that on any given project, the majority of the code contained in it, will be code from many different 
sources. You will invariably make use of Libraries, Frameworks, Components, Shared Code and at time Copy and Pasted code
from other sources. Even the programming language you choose to develop your software is based on code developed by
others.

Software development, is very much a team sport, the difference being that in all probability you will never meet or 
even know everybody on your team or contributing to your project.  The only aspect of those people you're ever going to 
physically see, is their code.

## Source Code Repository

The primary means developers interact with another and code, is through what is called a **_Source Code Repository_**
and there are many different types.  Source Code Repositories can be either _Public_ or _Private_ and sometimes they
can be a mixture of both.

> repository 
> 
> 1. **a place or container in which things can be stored for safety**
> 2. a place where things are kept for exhibition; museum
> 3. (Commerce) a place where commodities are kept before being sold; warehouse
> 4. a place of burial; sepulchre
> 5. a receptacle containing the relics of the dead
> 6. a person to whom a secret is entrusted; confidant
 

### Private Source Code Repositories

These are generally used by individuals, companies or organisations that only want to share their source code with 
individuals, companies or other organisations they trust. Often to protect Copyright, Patents or to store source code 
which is proprietary - meaning code that is for sale.

### Public Source Code Repositories

A public source code repository is used by developers to share code with anybody, essentially the _**Public**_ in this 
context.  Typically, software project which make use of Public Source Code Repositories are termed as **Open Source
Projects**, which loosely means the source code is free to see, read and share by anyone.

There are different licensing models available which sometimes could restrict you or even require payment for
you to use the software, but generally most Open Source Projects can be free to use too.
