In [How to use Package Management In Javascript projects](https://geekiam.io/how-to-use-package-management-in-java-script-projects) we discussed project specific node package management configuration options and also introduced the `package.json` file and how it is used as the configuration management repository.

In this, we will take a deeper dive into the `package.json` and explore it further.

### What is the package.json file

The `package.json` is one of the core components of the Node runtime environment, and it typically included in the project root directory of all node based projects. It is a plain text JSON file which contains the basic metadata, dependencies, configuration and build information about the project.

The `package.json` file:
* Lists the packages your project depends on
* Specifies the version number of your project
* Contains build and environment configuration detail

### How to create `package.json`

#### Manually creating a package.json file
 
It is possible to create a `package.json` manually by creating by simply JSON format text file and adding the required fields and whichever other fields you desire. 

#### Package.json required fields

There are only two fields that all `package.json` must contain:

*  **name** : packageâ€™s name, and must be lowercase and one word, and may contain hyphens and underscores.
* **version** : field must be in the form x.x.x and follow the [semantic versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).

The below is an example of the simplest `package.json` file possible

```javascript
{
  "name": "simple-package",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

```

#### Creating a package.json with a package management tool

The most common and popular why of creating a `package.json` file is by making use of a package management tool. Two of the most popular and common package management tools available are [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

```sh
### Create a package.json using npm
npm init

### Create a package.json using yarn
yarn init
```
