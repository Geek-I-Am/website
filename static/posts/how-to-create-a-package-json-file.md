In [How to use Package Management In Javascript projects](https://geekiam.io/how-to-use-package-management-in-java-script-projects) we discussed project specific node package management configuration options and also introduced the `package.json` file and how it is used as the configuration management repository.

In this, we will take a deeper dive into the `package.json` and explore it further.

### What is the package.json file

The `package.json` is one of the core components of the Node runtime environment, and it typically included in the project root directory of all node based projects. It is a plain text JSON file which contains the basic metadata, dependencies, configuration and build information about the project.

The `package.json` file:
* Lists the packages your project depends on
* Specifies the version number of your project
* Contains build and environment configuration detail

### How to create `package.json`

#### Manually creating a package.json file
 
It is possible to create a `package.json` manually by creating by simply JSON format text file and adding the required fields and whichever other fields you desire. 

#### Package.json required fields

There are only two mandatory directives that all `package.json` must contain:

*  **name** : packageâ€™s name, and must be lowercase and one word, and may contain hyphens and underscores.
* **version** : field must be in the form x.x.x and follow the [semantic versioning guidelines](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).

The below is an example of the simplest `package.json` file possible

```javascript
{
  "name": "simple-package",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}

```

#### Creating a package.json with a package management tool

The most common and popular why of creating a `package.json` file is by making use of a package management tool. Two of the most popular and common package management tools available are [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started).

```sh
### Create a package.json using npm
npm init

### Create a package.json using yarn
yarn init
``` 

When creating a `package.json` file with a package management tool, typically a questionaire will be launched to ask you to provide some additional information about your project.

The information obtained when then be included in optional directives to help others who will find your project to understand more about your project by providing some additional information like the `author`, `contributors`, `homepage` and `repository` fields.

### Optional Directives for package.json files
* **Description:** A brief description of the node.js project to provide relevant detail about the module\project.

* **main:** refers to the file where the application starts, this can be any JavaScript file that should be executed first.

* **keywords:** keywords related to the project. Used to index the project on relevant package management repositories for discovery.  You typically provide an array of strings to be used in the packages listing on *npm search*

* **author:** Developer name, company and email address. There are two accepted formats for supplying information, by either providing it as an JSON object format i.e.
```javascript
"author" : {  "name" : "threenine.co.uk",
              "email" : "hello@threenine.co.uk",
              "url" : "https://threenine.co.uk"
           }
```
or by providing it in a shorthand format on a single string
```javascript
"author" : "threenine.co.uk <hello@threenine.co.uk> (https://threenine.co.uk)"
```
 
* **contributors:** names of all the developers and the people who have contributed to this project.  The same formatting rules as authors apply however by supplying an array of people.
```javascript
"contributors" : [ {  "name" : "Gary Woodfine",
                      "email" : "hello@threenine.co.uk",
                      "url" : "https://garywoodfine.com"
                   },
                   {"Joe Blogs <hello@blogs.com> (https://blogs.com)"}

```


* **license: ** specify a license for your detailing how others are permitted to use your project, and any restrictions placed upon it.

```javascript
{
  "name": "simple-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An short description describing simple-package",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [
      "Amazing Software",
      "innovative solution",
      "Technology Education",
      "JavaScript Tutorials"
],
  "author": "geekiam.io <hello@geekiam.io> (https://geekiam.io)",
  "license": "ISC"
}

```

### Additional Directives

There are many more directives you can include to supply even more information regarding your project. The more information you provide increases the likelihood of your project being found and even used by others.

* **files :** An array of file patterns that describes the entries included when your package is installed as a dependency.  If you omit the field then the default of including all the files in in your directory will be applied.

Alternatively, you can provide an additional `.npmignore` file in the root of your directory or in sub-directories detailing which files and directories to exclude.

The `.npmignore` file works just like a `.gitignore`. If there is a `.gitignore` file, and `.npmignore` is missing, `.gitignore` contents will be used instead.
