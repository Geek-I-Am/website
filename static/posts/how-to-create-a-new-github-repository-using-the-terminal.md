In [Learn The Basics Of Version Control To Become A Master](https://geekiam.co.uk/learn-the-basics-of-version-control-to-become-a-master/) we discussed the basic principles, use cases and terms regarding version control. You have more than likely now realized that all software projects will require some form of version control.  Even if you are the only developer that will be working on the project, it makes absolute sense to create a version control repository.

Version control systems not only help you in keeping track of changes and overcoming errors whilst coding, but they also help you to keep your code safe and helping ensure you never lose or delete your code.  

GitHub is a code hosting platform for collaboration and version control, which not only enables you and others work together on projects, but it also enables you to safely store your code online, so you don't have to worry about servers and managing them. Despite Github being a for profit company they provide free access to developers to host and share code with over 50 millions other developers world-wide
