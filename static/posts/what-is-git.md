In [Learn The Basics Of Version Control To Become A Master](https://geekiam.io/learn-the-basics-of-version-control-to-become-a-master/) we discussed the basics of version control systems and discussed their background and why they have become become a vital component in all software development projects.

Over the years software developers have explored and used many different approaches and tools for version control systems and the current most popular tool in use today is [git distributed version control](https://git-scm.com/ "Git - free and open source distributed version control system")

### What is git

Git is a free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2 for distributed version-control systems to track changes in source code during software development. It is purposely designed for coordinating work in software development teams, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 

The primary goals git are aimed at the typical use cases for software developers which include: 
* speed
* data integrity
* support for distributed team workflows

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
 Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version-control systems, and unlike most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server..
