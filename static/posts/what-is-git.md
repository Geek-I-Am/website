In [Learn The Basics Of Version Control To Become A Master](https://geekiam.io/learn-the-basics-of-version-control-to-become-a-master/) we discussed the basics of version control systems and discussed their background and why they have become become a vital component in all software development projects.

Over the years software developers have explored and used many different approaches and tools for version control systems and the current most popular tool in use today is [git distributed version control](https://git-scm.com/ "Git - free and open source distributed version control system")

### What is git

Git is a free and open-source software distributed under GNU General Public License Version 2 for distributed version-control systems to track changes in source code during software development. It is purposely designed for coordinating work in software development teams, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. 

The primary goals git are aimed at the typical use cases for software developers which include: 
* speed
* data integrity
* support for distributed team workflows

Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development. Since 2005,Git has evolved and matured to be amazingly fast and efficient with an incredible branching system that enables non-linear development.

Git is distributed version-control systems, and every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server.

### Why do software developers like git?

There are few characteristics about git that make it a popular choice for software developers and understanding these key properties actually make git easier to user and comprehend.

#### Snapshots

The major difference between Git and any other common Version Control Systems (VCS)  is the way data and details about files is treated by Git. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes or they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time, this is commonly described as delta-based version control.
