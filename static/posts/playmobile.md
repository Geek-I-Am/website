It’s a thing that you play with and it’s really fun but their needs to be improvements.

### New ideas 

Make the little girls hair better because it’s always short and it’s a bit annoying.

And put more people in a pack.

And make willow trees because most of the trees are the same.

And more pools just to make it fun.

Put two sets of clothing so if you get bored of one you can put the other set of clothing on .

And make them have different eye colour because it’s always brown, which is boring.

Make them have eyebrows because you need eyebrows.

Make their mouth not brown because no one has a brown mouth. Make them have bracelets some need jewelry.make them have fingers because you can’t have half circle for a hand. Make them do more than one thing because the foot -boller does only one thing and that’s kicking the ball but no one does kicks the ball all of their lives do they . make them have pupils because then they can’t see. Make the children have eye lashes. And you could add in tower blocks so it comes with more characters and less money.

It was my birthday and my nanny got me PlayMobil I really liked it but i didn't like all the rapper it was in because it didn't need it it's just wasteful and doesn't help the planet so think about that.How about you try making them look a bit realistic and flexible so people  can make there games more fun . 

You could possibly add in electricity  for detail and so you could look at things clearly so you don't break things.How about making computers that actually works.

There could be a chance that you could make towers as tall as a nine year old so there back doesn't hurt and it doesn't stop us from playing our fabulous games of PlayMobil .
