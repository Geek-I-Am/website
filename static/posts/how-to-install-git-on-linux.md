Git is the most popular distributed version control system among developers, especially Linux-based software developers. In this tutorial we'll guide you through the process to
install and configure git for use on your Ubuntu and Debian based Linux.  

You may have previously [learned the basics of version control](https://geekiam.io/learn-the-basics-of-version-control-to-become-a-master/ "Learn The Basics Of Version Control To Become A Master | Geek.I.Am") and read [background information on git](https://geekiam.io/what-is-git/ "What is git | Geek.I.Am"), in this post we are going to learn how to install and configure git on a Debian based Linux distribution.

### Install Git using a package manager
The easiet and recommended way to install Git is to install making use of a package manager. The most common package management on Debian based distribution is **apt *(Advanced Package Tool)* **, which is used and tightly integrated Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Kali, PopOS etc.
 
 Depending on your distribution and release version, there may be a possibility that git is already installed, therefore it is worth double checking.
 
 To check if git may be already installed, simply using the [terminal window](https://geekiam.io/what-is-a-terminal-window/ "What is the terminal window | Geek.I.Am") to check the version number.
 ```shell script
git --version
```
If the command returns a response similar to the below, then git has been previously installed.

If git is not installed then the command will return a message indicating that git could not be found, if that is the case then we can update and upgrade our packages to ensure we get the latest possible version, and then install it.

```shell script
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install git
```
Once the installation is complete we can once again verify installation and version number using the `git --version` command again, which should now confirm Git has been successfully installed.

### Git Configuration
Git enables you to set a global and per-project *username* and *email address* , and you can easily administer your git identity using the `git config` command.

### Configure Global Username and Email
The global git username and email address are associated with commits on all repositories on your system that donâ€™t have repository-specific configuration values.

To configure your global commit name and email address run the `git config` command with the `--global` option

```shell script
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "email@domain.com"
```
Once you've completed configuring your name and email you can verify your settings anytime using:

```shell script
git config --list
```

Which will return something similar to:

```shell script
user.name=Your Name
user.email=email@domain.com
```

Git stores your configuration details in a hidden text based file gitconfig in your Home directory `~/.gitconfig`.

You can use any text based editor to view these details, in our case we'll use `nano`

```shell script
nano ~/.gitconfig
```
Which will look similar to
```shell script
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = email@domain.com
```

You can continue to make configuration changes either by editing the `~/.gitconfig` in your text editor or making use of the `git config` command.

At this point, it may be worth checking out [How To Create Git Ignore Files](https://geekiam.io/how-to-create-git-ignore-files/ "How to create git ignore files | Geek.I.Am") to learn about configuring a global git ignore file.

### Conclusion
Installing Git on Debian based Linux Distribution is a matter of making use of the APT package manager.  

I recommend the [Pro Git book](https://amzn.to/308IsHT "Pro Git 2nd ed. Edition") and learn more about how to use Git.
