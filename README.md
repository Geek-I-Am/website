One very boring rainy stormy weekend in November led myself and my 8 year old daughter in starting a blog for her to 
her own blog to talk about one of her favourite past times in playing computer/video games.

So we both started working on a [fun side project](https://garywoodfine.com/the-importance-of-side-projects/) to cure the boredom, [Geek.I.Am blog](https://geekiam.co.uk), fun for her so she can 
learn more about writing, blogging and the internet and fun for me as I get to play with a whole lot of new stuff I have
not been previously familiar with.
